API
-----------
API is the core concept in gateway. You can use admin to manage your APIs. 

# API fields
* Name
  The API Name

* URL
  URL is a regex pattern for match request url. If a origin request url matches this value, proxy dispatch request to nodes which is defined in this api.

* Method
  API Http method,  the request must match both URL and method. `*` is match all http method(GET,PUT,POST,DELETE)

* Status
  API status, value range is UP and Down.

* Access Control
  Access control is a black and white list based on access client ip. It's a json configuration like this:
  
  ```json
  {
      "blacklist": [
          "127.*",
          "127.0.0.*",
          "127.0.*",
          "127.0.0.1"
      ],
      "whitelist": [
          "127.*",
          "127.0.0.*",
          "127.0.*",
          "127.0.0.1"
      ]
  }
  ```

* Mock
  A mock json configuration like this
  ```json
  {
    "value": "{\"abc\":\"hello\"}",
    "contentType": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    "headers": [
        {
            "name": "header1",
            "value": "value1"
        }
    ],
    "cookies": [
        "test-c=1",  // it's a set-cookie header string format
        "test-c2=2"  // it's a set-cookie header string format
    ]
}
  ```
  value is required, contentType, headers and cookies are optional.

  Note. If proxy get any error(e.g. has no backend server, backend return a error code) by this API, proxy will use mock to response.

* Nodes
  API nodes is a list infomation. Every Node has 4 attrbutes: cluster, attrbute name, rewrite. Proxy will dispatch origin request to these nodes, and wait for all response, than merge to response to client.

  * Cluster (required)
    Which cluster to send. Proxy will use a balancer to select a backend server from this cluster to send request.

  * Attrbute name (required when nodes size > 1)
    This value is used for merge action. Example, we have 2 nodes, one is set to `base` and responsed value is `{"name":"user1"}`, one is set to `account` and responsed value is `{"money":1000}`, after merge, result is `{"base": {"name":"user1"}, "account": {"money":1000}}`.
    
  * Rewrite (optional)
    Used for you want to rewite origin url to your wanted. It usually work together with **URL** attrbute. In actual, we need use proxy for a old system, but the old system's API is design not restful friendly. In this scenes, we want to provide a beatful API design to other user. The URL rewrite is a solution. For example, a old system provide a API `/user?userId=xxx`, and we want to provide a API like this `/api/users/xxx`, you can set **Url** to `/api/users/(.+)` and set **rewite** to `/user?userId=$1`.

  * Validations (optional)
    Validations rules is used for validate request. It support setting a validation rule for query string args and form data. It is a json array configuration like:
    
    ```json
    [
        {
            "attr": "abc",  // query string arg name or a form data field name
            "getFrom": 0,   // enum value, 0: query string. 1: form data 
            "required": true, // is required
            "rules": [
                {
                    "type": 0, // enum value, validate method. 0: regexp. Currently, only support regexp.
                    "expression": "\\d+" 
                },
                {
                    "type": 0,
                    "expression": ""
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    ```
