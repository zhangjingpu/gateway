Gateway
-------
Gateway is a http restful API gateway. 

[简体中文](./docs-cn/README.md)

# Features
* Traffic Control
* Circuit Breaker
* Loadbalance
* Service Discovery
* Plugin mechanism
* Routing based on URL
* API aggregation
* API Validation
* API Access Control(blacklist and whitelist)
* API Mock
* Backend Server heath check
* Use [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp)
* Admin WEBUI

# Install
Gateway dependency [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) or [consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul)

## Compile from source
You are must used go1.8 beause of the plugin mechanism.

```
git clone https://github.com/fagongzi/gateway.git
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fagongzi/gateway
go build cmd/proxy/proxy.go
go build cmd/admin/admin.go
```

## Download binary file
[linux-64bit](http://7xtbpp.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/gateway-linux64.tar.gz)

## Docker
You can run `docker pull fagongzi/gateway` to get docker images, then use `docker run -d fagongzi/gateway` to run. It export 3 ports:

* 80

  proxy http serve port

* 8081

  proxy manager port

* 8080
  
  admin http port

You can read [this](./docs/build.md) for more infomation about build and run gateway.

# Architecture
![](./images/arch.png)

## Components
Gateway has three component: proxy, admin, etcd.

### Proxy
The proxy provide http server. Proxy is stateless, you can scale proxy node to deal with large traffic.

### Admin 
The admin is a backend manager system. Admin also is a stateless node, you can use a Nginx node for HA. One Admin node can manager a set of proxy which has a same etcd prefix configuration.

### Etcd Or Consul
The Etcd or consul store gateway's mete data.

## Concept of gateway

* Server

  Server is a backend server which provide restfule json service.The server is the basic unit at gateway. [more](./docs/server.md).

* Cluster

  Cluster is a set of servers which provide the same service. The Loadbalancer select a usable server to use. [more](./docs/cluster.md).

* API

  API is the core concept in gateway.  You can define a API with a URL pattern, http method, and at least one dispatch node. [more](./docs/api.md).

* Routing

  Routing is a approach to control http traffic to clusters. You can use cookie, query string, request header infomation in a expression for control.

# What gateway can help you
## API Definition
You can define restful API based on backend real apis. You can also define a aggregation API use more backend apis.

## Validation
You can create some validation rules for api, these rules can validate args of api is correct.

## API Mock
You can create a mock API. These API is not depend on backend server api. It can used for front-end developer or default return value that the back-end server does not respond to.

## Protect backend server
Gateway can use **Traffic Control** and **Circuit Breaker** functions to avoid backend crash by hight triffic.

## AB Test
Gateway's **Routing** fucntion can help your AB Test.

# Plugin mechanism
Gateway provides the following extension points with the plugin mechanism of go1.8

* Filter
   Use the plugin mechanism of go1.8 to write custom plugins and extend the gateway function. [How to write a custom filter](./docs/plugin-filter.md)
